# InstaRepair Website
This website was made during web technology coursework just for the sake of practice and learning AJAX basically. The website is a one part of 'Just Dial' website that everyone is aware of. This website is specifically for finding repairing shops for electronic items. It lets you search shops and shopkeepers for your electronics. User can search using shopname , location, shopkeeper name,address, etc. The shopkeepers need to make an account on the website. They then update details of their shops using dashboard. The dashboard was designed using ajax and jQuery. All the responses from the dashboard wer fully dynamic and without the need for page reloading. This was the key feature i learned from this website.
